# number-guessing-game
This is a number guessing game created in C programming language.

In creating this program you will be able to test your programming skills in C.
In this program loops, conditional statements and operators are used.
To generate random numbers, the 'stdlib.h' library is used.

This is project 1 from code with harry's 'The ultimate C programming course'. Don't forget to check it out on youtube.

Once you compiled this program using 'gcc main.c -o main' and run in terminal using './main'
you will be asked to input any number between 1 to 100.
Enter any number between 1 to 100 and boom!
The game will tell you whether you are guessed correct or you want to enter a lower or greater number.
You can play it with your friend and whoever guess the number in less number of guesses is the winner.

Note: There are some errors in this program, in future I will definietly improve it. If you have some good knowledge in making it more better feel free to drop a pull request.

Happy coding!
